        <h4>React JS based NBA Player Strength Visualization</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Created a dashboard using
            <strong>React, D3, and Ant Design</strong> backed by API from
            stats.nba.com to visualize individual player's shot data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created four extra filters and two shot themes (hexbin and scatter)
            to provide more customized visualization on the shot charset
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed an autocomplete player search bar providing a list of

          <li>
            Built relational databases(<strong>MySQL</strong>) to store user

          My favorite project was the latest one, developing a react and
          spring-based webcam personal fitness training website. I had a great team
          to work on: (1) building an interactive, scalable website to support user
          registration, training schedule and video stream with a trainer based on
          React, Redux, and Spring; (2) implementing a schedule calendar with
          big-react0calendar; (3) using OpenTok API to implement classroom video
          chat function. This project expanded my knowledge and enhanced my
          programming capabilities during above-mentioned steps. The most exciting
          and energizing parts were that our team did a great job of building a
          project from scratch and I was trained by a professional software engineer
          during this process. Through the whole progress, our working efficiency
          was emphasized by using (1) Sneakpeekit to sketch the wireframe of our
          website; (2) Google Docs to update daily progress and difficulties; (3)
          Zoom to set up engineer meeting on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; (4) Git
          to handle version-control, track changes of each file; (5) PowerPoint to
          present to the project manager at the end. I believe I will put my best
          into this internship and diverse skills into practice as a prepared
          software engineer for your company.

        Completing a project with limited teammates was challenging, our team
        started with eight people but ended with four. For their personal reasons,
        four members left before hitting the mid-range of the project. Initially,
        due to the limited time period and technical difficulties, these issues
        led to our lack of motivation in continuously achieving the project. As a
        software engineer, I suffered from not being productive for our team, not
        standing up for our team, and not being helpful for the other three
        teammates who also lost confidence. It was not until then that I realized
        the significance of leadership and decided to fight for this situation. I
        decided to have a conversation with our project manager to come up with a
        new minimum viable product. In order to deploy the project on time,
        picking up on what they remained was necessary. Therefore, I did more jobs
        on video stream API, testing existed code and communicating between
        front-end and back-end people. Thanks to my last three teammates, we were
        able to implement this interactive, scalable website project successfully
        in an extremely short time.
